                                                        Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking service 
                                                        owned by Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, 
                                                        and launched in October 2010 exclusively on iOS.Instagram began development 
                                                        in San Francisco, when Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger chose to focus their 
                                                        multi-featured HTML5 check-in project, Burbn, on mobile photography. 
                                                        As Krieger reasoned, Burbn became too similar to Foursquare, and both realized
                                                        that it had gone too far. Burbn was then pivoted to become more focused on 
                                                        photo-sharing.The word Instagram is a portmanteau of instant camera and 
                                                        telegram.Kevin Systrom posted the first photo to Instagram on July 16,
                                                        2010.The photo shows a dog in Mexico and Systrom's girlfriend's foot; the 
                                                        photo has been enhanced using Instagram's X-PRO2 filter.
